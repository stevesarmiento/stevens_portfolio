          <h2>A little back story</h2>
          <p>
            I started learning by designing ideas I had and teaching myself to build websites. In 2010 I built a business that sold craft-beer from local breweries to people in over 36 states. Being a part of <a class="link-hover" target="_blank" href="#">Untapped Brews</a> allowd me to grow my understanding of communication, brand design, and building out marketing strategies for a business. 
          </p>  
          <p>

            When Untapped ended, I took an opportunity to work with a great team at <a class="link-hover" target="_blank" href="http://chooserethink.com/">re:think</a>, an agency where I grew my chops as a visual designer by creating websites, logos, icons, and interfaces; ultimately mastering the tools I use every day.
          </p>  
          <p>
            Present day, I live in and work in Hayward, California where I've helped build the marketing team for an amazing nonprofit graduate program at <a class="link-hover" target="_blank" href="https://lifewest.edu">Life West.</a> As their web developer &amp; designer I contribute to building the story and brand for an institution that is shaping the next generation of healthcare professionals and personal health globally.

            <h2>What I've Learned</h2>
              <p>
                <a class="link-hover" target="_blank" href="#">re:think</a> is a New Jersey based web agency that helps local businesses build their online presence and grow their business with the help of a proper website and an SEO/content marketing strategy. I was hired as their first Visual Designer to speed up their design workflow for 20+ local businesses.
              </p>
              <p>
                What I learned at and took away from re:think was how to design and mock up prototypes and mock-ups quickly. Being the only visual designer on the team helped me build and grow my understanding of programs like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Sketch. I worked with project managers and clients to gather the feedback and content needed. I then pushed designs to the developers to built out.
              </p>
              <p>
                I began by designing ads, website assets, icons and logo marks. Then quickly progressed to web designs and user interfaces. Those experience was key to my learning. While working on the team we achieved #370 on the Inc 500’s list of fastest growing companies in our locale. They have continued to grow to #330.
              </p>

              <p>
                I’m grateful, thankful, and amazed to have had this experience so early on. The fast paced environment, small team, and great humans helped build my workflow, processes, and experience in a fast paced environment.
              </p>

              <p>
                Learning truly never stops. I submerse myself in it as much as I can, in order to create and build the future I want to see.    
              </p>
              <p>
                Working freelance allows me to take on projects that I may have not been able to explore in a normal 9-5, allowing me to build upon my knowledge of programming languages. This also allows me to communicate easily with developer teams as well as designers and be able to articulate ideas and concepts in a manner that they both can understand.
              </p>
              <p>
                Freelancing has allowd me to organize and optimize my focus as well as build on what’s important when working on multiple projects at once. I've built time management and project management skills. Working with many clients/projects/contractors at once can be overwhelming but I've been able to create a process that work for me and not against me.

                          <strong>Untapped Brews</strong> was an online retail store for local craft breweries. The benefit was the breweries were able to sell to consumer at a discounted rate and reach a far wider audience. Breweries would have access to our users and we would provide their beer at a special rate on our platform.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Untapped Brews consisted of 3 co-founders (2 active founders, 1 silent partner). I handled everything design related, in addition to filling the role of marketer and shipping manager while my co-founder handled the business side.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          We ran Untapped Brews for about 2 years hosting local craft beer events and selling craft beers nationally. We handing everything from shipping logistics, sourcing new products, packaging, as well as website sales, marketing, design, branding, and every other little detail that is involved in running a small business.

                          <strong>It was rewarding experience as well as a humbling one</strong> to learn and grow as an business owner, marketer, and designer.

            <p>
              In a non for profit orginization, time and budget are considerations when redesigning. Tools like Wordpress are amazing ways to cut costs and keep development time to a minimum. While Wordpress is a versitle content management system, often times the base themes and their functionality don't meet the needs of the organizations using them. This leads to custom developed pages, plugins and functionality using languages such as HTML, CSS, PHP, and Javascript.
